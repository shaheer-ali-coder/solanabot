# Solana Sniper Bot

The Solana Sniper is a powerful Python-based tool designed to automate the process of buying and selling coins on the Solana blockchain. It allows you to set stop loss and limit orders, enabling you to execute trades automatically based on your predefined criteria. The sniper will snipe tokens from telegram channels based on CA or a birdeye url. Raydium has been added too because Jupiter does not support low liquidity coins.

## FAQS
### 1. How to install requirements?
Each OS is different from mine _(e.g. amount/types of garbage in my OS)_, I cannot assist you and guide you step by step on how to install requirements... In the current world, chatgpt exists, you may ask chatgpt such questions. Its simple run the command, if you get error then read it and try to understand what the error is saying or check the error on chatgpt.
### 2. Program did not show up anything and stopped!
Most likely your config.ini is missing, you have to put the right data in it e.g. Required sections are [TELEGRAM], [DISCORD], [WALLET] and [INFURA_URL]
### 3. What is senderUserNames in config.ini section TELEGRAM?
It is the username of channel where the tokens are pasted, the bot would like to know those usernames and then snipe the tokens.
